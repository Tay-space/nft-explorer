<h1 align="center">NFT Explorer</h1>

*NFT Explorer* is a web app that analyzes NFT collections and generates rarity scores for users to sort and view NFTs by rarity. It will do so by pulling NFT data from the blockchain, rendering the NFT images/data, and assigning a rarity score for each NFT representing how rare an NFT is. <br><br>

## What are NFTs?

NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) are digital assets that represent real-world objects, like art, music, or videos. They are primarily stored on the Ethereum blockchain, and traded online using cryptocurrency. The most popular NFTs today are part of generative art collections, such as CryptoPunks, or Bored Ape Yacht Club. These NFT collections are incredibly successful because owning one of these NFTs gives you special access and a feeling of belonging to an exclusive community.

These generative NFT collections consist of avatars with randomly generated features (such as hair color, face style, shirt color), with certain features being more common or rarer than others. So an NFT can be significantly rarer than another if it has multiple rare traits(e.g. unique hair color or accessories), while the other only has common traits.

For an investor looking to buy into an NFT project, they will go through all NFTs in a collection to find ones that they like in terms of look and overall rarity. Rarity is most important to an investor because rarer NFTs have more potential to increase in value over time. It's important to make sure you are spending the right amount for an NFT. No one wants to buy a common NFT at high prices!

*NFT Explorer* gives investors and collectors a compass to navigate the wild-west of NFTs. Users can narrow their focus to the rarest NFTs in a collection, and make the most informed decision when buying into an NFT project. <br><br>


## In NFT Explorer, users will be able to: 
<ul>
  <li> View complete NFT collections, including images and NFT traits.</li>
  <li> See overall NFT rarity depending on a combination of its traits.</li>
  <li> Input a contract address to view any NFT collection. </li>
  <li> Sort NFT collection by rarity </li>
  <li> Sort NFT collection by token id number </li>
</ul>


## Technologies
<ul>
  <li> Javascript to calculate rarity and handle sorting logic </li>
  <li> Moralis API to pull blockchain data </li>
  <li> CSS for styling </li>
</ul> 

## Implementation Timeline
Note to self: complete by end of day
<ul>
  <li>Friday: Write a javascript program that uses an API to pull nft data from the blockchain. Finalize rarity score formula and server.</l1>

  <li>Sunday: Research and design the scoring algorithm for NFTs. If there is time, create a front end that can render a single set of NFTs.</l1>

  <li>Monday: Create a dropdown list for several NFT collections. I will try to implement an option to additionally sort the nfts by id #, or by random order.</l1>

  <li>Due Date: Finalize and flesh out the front end aesthetics. If there is a back-end, I will figure out how to host my project.</l1>
</ul>
